00:00 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much,   everybody. (Applause.) Wow. 
Thank you very, very much.
00:06 Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, 
Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts,  
00:15 justices of the Supreme Court of the United 
States, President Clinton, President Bush,  
00:25 President Obama, President Biden, Vice President 
Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of  
00:36 America begins right now. (Applause.)  
 
00:47 From this day forward, our country will   flourish and be respected again all over the 
world. We will be the envy of every nation,  
00:56 and we will not allow ourselves 
to be taken advantage of any   longer. During every single day of 
the Trump administration, I will,  
01:07 very simply, put America first. (Applause.) 
 
Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety  
01:23 will be restored. The scales of justice 
will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent,  
01:31 and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department 
and our government will end. (Applause.)  
  
01:44 And our top priority will be to create a nation 
that is proud, prosperous, and free. (Applause.)
01:56 America will soon be greater, stronger, and far   more exceptional than ever before. (Applause.) 
 
I return to the presidency confident and  
02:12 optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling 
new era of national success. A tide of change is  
02:19 sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the 
entire world, and America has the chance to seize  
02:26 this opportunity like never before.  
 
But first, we must be honest about the  
02:31 challenges we face. While they are 
plentiful, they will be annihilated   by this great momentum that the world is now 
witnessing in the United States of America. 
  
02:43 As we gather today, our government confronts 
a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical  
02:49 and corrupt establishment has extracted 
power and wealth from our citizens while  
02:54 the pillars of our society lay broken 
and seemingly in complete disrepair.  
  
03:00 We now have a government that cannot 
manage even a simple crisis at home while,   at the same time, stumbling into a continuing 
catalogue of catastrophic events abroad. 
  
03:12 It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding 
American citizens but provides sanctuary and  
03:18 protection for dangerous criminals, many 
from prisons and mental institutions,  
03:24 that have illegally entered our 
country from all over the world.  
   We have a government that has given 
unlimited funding to the defense of  
03:32 foreign borders but refuses to defend American 
borders or, more importantly, its own people. 
  
03:40 Our country can no longer deliver basic services 
in times of emergency, as recently shown by the  
03:47 wonderful people of North Carolina — who have been 
treated so badly — (applause) — and other states  
03:58 who are still suffering from a hurricane that 
took place many months ago or, more recently,  
04:03 Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still 
tragically burn from weeks ago without even a  
04:11 token of defense. They’re raging through the 
houses and communities, even affecting some  
04:17 of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals 
in our country — some of whom are sitting here  
04:22 right now. They don’t have a home any longer. 
That’s interesting. But we can’t let this happen.  
04:30 Everyone is unable to do anything 
about it. That’s going to change. 
  
04:36 We have a public health system that 
does not deliver in times of disaster,   yet more money is spent on it than 
any country anywhere in the world.
04:45 And we have an education system that teaches 
our children to be ashamed of themselves — in   many cases, to hate our country despite the 
love that we try so desperately to provide to  
04:56 them. All of this will change starting today, 
and it will change very quickly. (Applause.)
  
05:13 My recent election is a mandate to completely 
and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and  
05:21 all of these many betrayals that have taken 
place and to give the people back their faith,  
05:28 their wealth, their democracy, and, 
indeed, their freedom. From this moment on,  
05:36 America’s decline is over. (Applause.)
 
Our liberties and our nation’s glorious  
05:52 destiny will no longer be denied. And we 
will immediately restore the integrity,  
05:58 competency, and loyalty of America’s government. 
 
Over the past eight years, I have been tested and  
06:05 challenged more than any president in our 250-year 
history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way. 
  
06:13 The journey to reclaim our republic has not 
been an easy one — that, I can tell you.  
06:20 Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to 
take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life. 
  
06:29 Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania 
field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear.  
06:37 But I felt then and believe even more so now that 
my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God  
06:45 to make America great again. (Applause.)
 
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
07:07 Thank you very much. (Applause.)
 
That is why each day under our administration  
07:22 of American patriots, we will be working to meet 
every crisis with dignity and power and strength.  
07:30 We will move with purpose and speed to bring back 
hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens  
07:37 of every race, religion, color, and creed. 
 
For American citizens, January 20th, 2025,  
07:47 is Liberation Day. (Applause.) It is my hope 
that our recent presidential election will be  
08:02 remembered as the greatest and most consequential 
election in the history of our country.  
  
08:08 As our victory showed, the entire nation 
is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with  
08:14 dramatic increases in support from virtually 
every element of our society: young and old,  
08:20 men and women, African Americans, Hispanic 
Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban,  
08:26 rural. And very importantly, we had 
a powerful win in all seven swing  
08:32 states — (applause) — and the popular vote, 
we won by millions of people. (Applause.)
08:42 To the Black and Hispanic communities, 
I want to thank you for the tremendous   outpouring of love and trust that you have 
shown me with your vote. We set records,  
08:55 and I will not forget it. I’ve heard your 
voices in the campaign, and I look forward  
08:60 to working with you in the years to come. 
 
Today is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor  
09:06 — this will be a great honor. But in his honor, we 
will strive together to make his dream a reality.  
09:15 We will make his dream come true. (Applause.)
 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
  
09:37 National unity is now returning to America, and 
confidence and pride is soaring like never before.  
09:47 In everything we do, my administration will be 
inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and  
09:52 unrelenting success. We will not forget our 
country, we will not forget our Constitution,  
09:60 and we will not forget our God. 
Can’t do that. (Applause.)
  
10:16 Today, I will sign a series of historic 
executive orders. With these actions,  
10:22 we will begin the complete restoration of 
America and the revolution of common sense.  
10:29 It’s all about common sense. (Applause.)
 
First, I will declare a national emergency  
10:37 at our southern border. (Applause.)
  
11:05 All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and 
we will begin the process of returning millions  
11:12 and millions of criminal aliens back to the places 
from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain  
11:21 in Mexico policy. (Applause.)
 
I will end the practice of  
11:31 catch and release. (Applause.)
 
And I will send troops to the  
11:38 southern border to repel the disastrous invasion   of our country. (Applause.)
 
Under the orders I sign today,  
11:50 we will also be designating the cartels as 
foreign terrorist organizations. 
  
11:57 (Applause.)
12:13 And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, 
I will direct our government to use the full  
12:23 and immense power of federal and state law 
enforcement to eliminate the presence of all   foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing 
devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our  
12:36 cities and inner cities. (Applause.) 
 
As commander in chief, I have no higher  
12:47 responsibility than to defend our country 
from threats and invasions, and that is  
12:52 exactly what I am going to do. We will do it 
at a level that nobody has ever seen before.
  
12:59 Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet 
to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to  
13:05 defeat what was record inflation and rapidly 
bring down costs and prices. (Applause.) 
  
13:18 The inflation crisis was caused by massive 
overspending and escalating energy prices,  
13:24 and that is why today I will also 
declare a national energy emergency.  
13:30 We will drill, baby, drill. (Applause.)
 
America will be a manufacturing nation once again,  
13:56 and we have something that no other manufacturing 
nation will ever have — the largest amount of oil  
14:02 and gas of any country on earth — and we are 
going to use it. We’ll use it. (Applause.)
  
14:11 We will bring prices down, fill our strategic 
reserves up again right to the top, and export  
14:19 American energy all over the world. (Applause.) 
 
We will be a rich nation again,  
14:30 and it is that liquid gold under 
our feet that will help to do it. 
  
14:36 With my actions today, we 
will end the Green New Deal,   and we will revoke the electric vehicle 
mandate, saving our auto industry and  
14:44 keeping my sacred pledge to our great 
American autoworkers. (Applause.)
  
15:01 In other words, you’ll be able 
to buy the car of your choice.
  
15:06 We will build automobiles in America 
again at a rate that nobody could have   dreamt possible just a few years ago. And 
thank you to the autoworkers of our nation  
15:16 for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did 
tremendously with their vote. (Applause.)  
  
15:24 I will immediately begin the overhaul of our 
trade system to protect American workers and  
15:32 families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich 
other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign  
15:40 countries to enrich our citizens. (Applause.)
 
For this purpose, we are establishing the  
15:53 External Revenue Service to collect all 
tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be  
16:01 massive amounts of money pouring into our 
Treasury, coming from foreign sources. 
  
16:08 The American dream will soon be 
back and thriving like never before. To restore competence and effectiveness to 
our federal government, my administration  
16:18 will establish the brand-new Department 
of Government Efficiency. (Applause.)
  
16:35 After years and years of illegal and 
unconstitutional federal efforts to   restrict free expression, I also will sign 
an executive order to immediately stop all  
16:46 government censorship and bring back 
free speech to America. (Applause.)
  
17:08 Never again will the immense power of the 
state be weaponized to persecute political  
17:14 opponents — something I know something 
about. (Laughter.) We will not allow  
17:19 that to happen. It will not happen again.
 
Under my leadership, we will restore fair,  
17:25 equal, and impartial justice under the 
constitutional rule of law. (Applause.)
  
17:35 And we are going to bring law and 
order back to our cities. (Applause.) 
  
17:44 This week, I will also end the government 
policy of trying to socially engineer  
17:50 race and gender into every aspect of 
public and private life. (Applause.)  
18:02 We will forge a society that is 
colorblind and merit-based. (Applause.)  
  
18:14 As of today, it will henceforth be 
the official policy of the United  
18:19 States government that there are only two 
genders: male and female. (Applause.)
  
18:42 This week, I will reinstate any service 
members who were unjustly expelled from our  
18:47 military for objecting to the COVID vaccine 
mandate with full back pay. (Applause.)
  
19:04 And I will sign an order to stop our warriors 
from being subjected to radical political  
19:10 theories and social experiments while on duty. 
It’s going to end immediately. (Applause.) Our  
19:19 armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole 
mission: defeating America’s enemies. (Applause.)
  
19:53 Like in 2017, we will again build the 
strongest military the world has ever seen.  
19:59 We will measure our success not only by 
the battles we win but also by the wars  
20:05 that we end — and perhaps most importantly, 
the wars we never get into. (Applause.)  
  
20:30 My proudest legacy will be that of a 
peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I  
20:35 want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.
 
I’m pleased to say that as of yesterday,  
20:41 one day before I assumed office,   the hostages in the Middle East are coming 
back home to their families. (Applause.)
  
21:09 Thank you.
 
America will reclaim its   rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, 
most respected nation on earth, inspiring the  
21:19 awe and admiration of the entire world. 
 
A short time from now, we are going to be  
21:25 changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to 
the Gulf of America — (applause) — and we  
21:31 will restore the name of a great president, 
William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it  
21:40 should be and where it belongs. (Applause.)
 
President McKinley made our country very rich  
21:54 through tariffs and through talent — he was a 
natural businessman — and gave Teddy Roosevelt  
22:01 the money for many of the great things he did, 
including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly  
22:07 been given to the country of Panama after the 
United Spates — the United States — I mean,  
22:13 think of this — spent more money than ever 
spent on a project before and lost 38,000  
22:21 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. 
 
We have been treated very badly from this  
22:27 foolish gift that should have never been made, 
and Panama’s promise to us has been broken. 
  
22:34 The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our 
treaty has been totally violated. American  
22:40 ships are being severely overcharged and not 
treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And  
22:49 that includes the United States Navy.
 
And above all, China is operating the  
22:55 Panama Canal. And we didn’t give 
it to China. We gave it to Panama,   and we’re taking it back. (Applause.)
 
Above all, my message to Americans today  
23:21 is that it is time for us to once again act 
with courage, vigor, and the vitality of  
23:27 history’s greatest civilization. 
 
So, as we liberate our nation,   we will lead it to new heights of victory and 
success. We will not be deterred. Together,  
23:39 we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep 
our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.  
  
23:46 The United States will once again consider itself 
a growing nation — one that increases our wealth,  
23:53 expands our territory, builds our cities, 
raises our expectations, and carries  
23:59 our flag into new and beautiful horizons.  
 
And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the  
24:05 stars, launching American astronauts to plant the 
Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars. (Applause.)
  
24:32 Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, 
and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than  
24:41 any other. There’s no nation like our nation.
 
Americans are explorers, builders, innovators,  
24:48 entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The 
spirit of the frontier is written   into our hearts. The call of the next great 
adventure resounds from within our souls. 
  
25:02 Our American ancestors turned a small group of 
colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a  
25:09 mighty republic of the most extraordinary 
citizens on Earth. No one comes close.
  
25:16 Americans pushed thousands of miles through 
a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They  
25:23 crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold 
dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued  
25:30 millions from tyranny, lifted billions from 
poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom,  
25:38 launched mankind into the heavens, and put the 
universe of human knowledge into the palm of the  
25:45 human hand. If we work together, there is nothing 
we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.  
  
25:53 Many people thought it was impossible 
for me to stage such a historic political  
25:58 comeback. But as you see today, here I am. 
The American people have spoken. (Applause.)
  
26:24 I stand before you now as proof that you 
should never believe that something is   impossible to do. In America, the 
impossible is what we do best. (Applause.)
  
26:41 From New York to Los Angeles, from 
Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami,  
26:48 from Houston to right here in Washington, 
D.C., our country was forged and built by  
26:54 the generations of patriots who gave everything 
they had for our rights and for our freedom.  
  
27:02 They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and 
factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners,  
27:08 police officers and pioneers who pushed 
onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle  
27:14 defeat their spirit or their pride.  
 
Together, they laid down the railroads,  
27:20 raised up the skyscrapers, built 
great highways, won two world wars,  
27:27 defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed 
over every single challenge that they faced. 
  
27:35 After all we have been through together, we 
stand on the verge of the four greatest years   in American history. With your help, we will 
restore America promise and we will rebuild the  
27:47 nation that we love — and we love it so much.  
 
We are one people, one family, and one glorious  
27:54 nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams 
for their child and every child who dreams for  
28:01 their future, I am with you, I will fight for 
you, and I will win for you. We’re going to  
28:08 win like never before. (Applause.)
 
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)
28:29 Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) In recent years, our nation has 
suffered greatly. But we are going   to bring it back and make it great 
again, greater than ever before. 
  
28:39 We will be a nation like no other, full of 
compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.  
28:45 Our power will stop all wars and bring a 
new spirit of unity to a world that has  
28:51 been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable. 
 
America will be respected again and admired again,  
28:59 including by people of religion, faith, 
and goodwill. We will be prosperous,  
29:05 we will be proud, we will be strong, 
and we will win like never before. 
  
29:11 We will not be conquered, we will not 
be intimidated, we will not be broken,  
29:17 and we will not fail. From this day on, the 
United States of America will be a free,  
29:22 sovereign, and independent nation. 
 
We will stand bravely, we will live proudly,  
29:29 we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in 
our way because we are Americans. The future is  
29:36 ours, and our golden age has just begun. 
 
Thank you. God bless America. Thank you  
29:43 all. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank 
you very much. Thank you very much.  
30:02 Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. (Applause.)
